Hello Zorbians!  We'll be posting Zorbio development updates here on this blog.
The game just entered alpha and is under rapid development.  Expect patch notes
and dev thoughts.

In the meantime, here are some pictures from earlier stages in the game's
development, including a few of my favorite graphical glitches.

We're excited to see where this game goes, and you guys will be a big part of
that!
