For the first time, [Jared][jared] and [I][me] participated in [Ludum
Dare][ld]!  Over the last weekend, we built a videogame, called **Square Off**,
from start to finish.  I would love to tell you all about it...

But first, [Play it!][sqoff]

And then, [Rate it!][ldsq]

Now, here are some of my first impressions of the competition.

## Planning

Planning ahead is difficult, because Ludum Dare announces a theme at the start
of the competition.  I'd thought of a game idea the week before and sketched
out some notes.  Minor details aside, the game turned out almost exactly like
the notes!

Unfortunately, we weren't able to integrate the theme, *shapeshifting*, into
the game.  Fortunately, the theme is optional!

## Multiplayer is hard

Multiplayer games seem to be pretty rare in game jams, probably due to the
difficulty.  Creating a multiplayer server is a lot of work, but more
importantly it's work that the people judging your game can't *see*.

Luckily for us, Jared (the "Server Whisperer") has a way of bending servers to
his will.  Our experience building [Zorbio](http://zor.bio), also a web-based
multiplayer game, was also a massive help.

## Don't kill yourself

I wouldn't dream of giving advice after just one Ludum Dare, but I think this
tip stands on its own.

Here's a timeline of our work on the game.  It's pretty tame.  No epic
all-nighters, just three 10~ hour days of solid work, and a couple of small
bugfixes on Tuesday.

The reviews from other Ludum Dare participants have been awesome to read.
Here's one from
[CasualCat](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=91982):

> That's pretty awesome! An 1v1 multiplayer game in 72 hours!? The game was
> really fun too, a very innovative take on air hockey. Reaction, strategy,
> tactics, it ran well too! Great game! And it was well polished.

And this one from [BlennosoftGames](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=8308):

> Wooo! Such a simple base concept, and yet the competitive strategies got
> quite deep! Much respect to whoever my worthy opponent was (Does it just
> always name your opponent "Jared" or was that really you?), and much more to
> your team for putting this together! 

Those two fine people also submitted some pretty awesome games.
