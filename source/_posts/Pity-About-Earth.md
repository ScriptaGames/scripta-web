> Humanity, listen up. This is the Universe. I am sick of you sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. That’s why there’s a huge asteroid heading straight for your pitiful Earth, courtesy of yours truly. I see you’ve built a flimsy Barrier and a stockpile of Missiles, but it won’t help. Enjoy the end times! Bye-bye. Talk soon.

Before last weekend, before Ludum Dare, I wrote a post about {% post_link Preparing-for-Ludum-Dare-38 "Preparing for Ludum Dare 38" %}.  It began as follows.

> Ludum Dare 38 is currently **hurtling through space** on a **direct trajectory** with next weekend.  **Impact** is estimated at 9PM on Friday, and the result will be a **chaotic, harebrained**, and fun-filled weekend. 

Emphasis added, becuase those words must have put us under some kind of spell.  Why?  Because over the weekend [Jared][jared] and I built a **chaotic**, **harebrained** game about protecting the Earth from asteroids on a **direct trajectory** with Earth.

Here's a short "timelapse" showing the progression of the game starting Saturday morning and ending Monday night, about 20 minutes before the submission deadline!
