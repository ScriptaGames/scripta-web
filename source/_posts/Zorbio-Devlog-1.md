Hello Zorbians!  This is the first devlog for our new game, Zorbio!

Zorbio is a a web-based 3D eat-em-up.  It’s got multiplayers.  It’s got WebGLs.
It has _shapes_!  [Play now!](http://zor.bio)

<!-- more -->

We’ll be posting Zorbio development updates here on this blog.
The game just entered alpha and is under rapid development.  Expect patch notes
and dev thoughts.

In the meantime, here are some pictures from earlier stages in the game’s
development, including a few of my favorite graphical glitches.

We’re excited to see where this game goes, and you guys will be a big part of
that!
