Zorbians, below you will find the patch notes for Zorbio version 1.0.5.

[Play Zorbio now!](http://zor.bio)

<!-- more -->

Changelog:

*   Added capture indicators: other players now have a colored ring around
their spheres which indicate their size relative to your own:{% asset_img "capture-indicator.jpg" "capture indicator screenshots" %}

    *   Green means you can eat the other player
    *   Yellow means you can eat the player, but they’re almost as big as you, so
speed boosting is risky
    *   Red means the other player is bigger, be careful!

*   Changes to the drain beam:

    *   You gain **bonus mass** when draining a player much larger than you
    *   The drain beam’s brightness corresponds with the amount of mass being
drained (this was already the case, but the effect is now more noticeable)
    *   Drain beams no longer appear between AI-controlled players

*   Added a loading indicator, which also resolves an issue where the UI would
appear, but remained unresponsive until the game finished loading

Bugfixes:

*   Fixed several server stability issues
*   Improved [speed infraction checking](https://github.com/ScriptaGames/zorbio-issues/issues/22)
